<h1>Predicting Commercial Vehicle Parking Duration using Generative Adversarial Multiple Imputation Networks</h1>
As the world rapidly urbanises in pace with economic growth, the rising demand for products and services in cities is putting a strain on the existing road infrastructure, leading to traffic congestion and other negative externalities. To mitigate the impacts of freight movement within commercial areas, city planners have begun focusing their attention on the parking behaviours of commercial vehicles. Unfortunately, there is a general lack of information on such activities due to the heterogeneity of practices and the complex nature of urban goods movement. Furthermore, field surveys and observations of truck parking behaviour are often faced with significant challenges, resulting in data that is sparse and incomplete.

<h2>Study Objective</h2>
The objective of this study is to develop a regression model to predict the parking duration of commercial vehicles at the loading bays of urban retail malls and identify significant factors that contribute to this dwell time. The dataset used in this study originates from a truck parking and observation survey conducted at the loading bays of nine retail malls in Singapore, containing information about the truck and driver’s activities. However, due to the presence of incomplete fields found in the dataset, the authors propose the use of a Generative Adversarial Multiple Imputation Networks algorithm to impute the incomplete fields before developing the regression model using the imputed dataset.

<h2>Data Description</h2>
The dataset used in this study originates from a commercial vehicle parking and observation survey that was conducted at nine urban retail malls in Singapore. For the first two urban retail malls, a combination of road-side video recordings, a loading bay observation survey, and electronic parking records was used to capture a comprehensive view of the activities occurring at both retail malls under observation. For the remaining seven urban retail malls, data collection was mainly concentrated at the loading bay where only the driver survey and vehicle observation was conducted.

<h2>Methodology</h2>
Due to the presence of incomplete fields found in the dataset, the development of the parking duration model follows a two-step approach. The first step involves the imputation of missing values found in the dataset by implementing the GAMIN algorithm to obtain a complete dataset. This dataset is subsequently passed through a gradient boosting algorithm to develop the final parking duration model in a supervised fashion.

The GAMIN algorithm follows the usual GAN approach of iteratively training the discriminator and generator by sampling mini-batches of size 𝐾 from the dataset during each training iteration. By modelling the discriminator 𝐷 and generator 𝐺 as fully connected neural networks, the algorithm begins by optimising discriminator 𝐷 with a fixed generator 𝐺 by computing a corresponding noise matrix 𝑧(𝑗) for each sample in the mini-batch (𝑥̃(𝑗),𝑚(𝑗)). Next, using 𝑥̃(𝑗), 𝑚(𝑗), and 𝑧(𝑗) as input, generator 𝐺 produces a complete data matrix 𝑥̅(𝑗) which will be combined with 𝑥̃(𝑗), for the observed components, to result in the imputed data matrix 𝑥̂(𝑗). The parameters of discriminator 𝐷 is adjusted during each training cycle to optimise its ability to differentiate between the imputed components against those originally observed.

Next, generator 𝐺 is optimised against the updated discriminator 𝐷 by using 𝑥̃(𝑗), 𝑚(𝑗), and 𝑧(𝑗) 19 to calculate its loss function. This loss function is dependent on generator 𝐺’s ability to fool discriminator 𝐷 into thinking that the imputed components are observed, while at the same time generating values that closely match the originally observed components. This process is repeated until the performance of both discriminator 𝐷 and generator 𝐺 converges.

Multiple imputation is achieved by generating multiple 𝑧𝑖(𝑗) values for the same mini-batch (𝑥̃(𝑗),𝑚(𝑗)) and passing it through generator 𝐺 to produce 𝐼 imputed data matrices 𝑥̂𝑖(𝑗), where 𝑖=1,…,𝐼 and 𝐼 equal to the number of imputations carried out. By passing each imputed data matrix 𝑥̂𝑖(𝑗) through a separate regression model, the predictions made by each regression model is combined through averaging to produce the final prediction.
